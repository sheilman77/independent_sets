The file tree_missing_list contains 823 positive integers that cannot be written as the number of independent sets of any tree.
It is conjectured that these are the only 823 positive integers with this property.

For these 823 numbers, the file verify_connected_planar_tree_missing.py verifies that all of these integers can be written as 
the number of independent sets of a planar graph.  And the file verify_unicyclic_or_forest.py verifies that all of these integers except 71, 119, 191
and 203 can be written as the number of independent sets of a unicyclic graph or a forest (and these graphs $G=(V,E)$ satisfy $|E|/|V|\leq1$)

The file tree_independent_set_verifier.cpp is C++ code that verifies that all integers up to some specified threshold
can be written as the number of independent sets of some tree (with 823 possible exceptions).
